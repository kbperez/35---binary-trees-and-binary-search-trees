# Lab 33: Binary trees and binary search trees
in your README, write documentation for you data structures
your documentation should includes code block usage examples
provide instructions for:
installing and using your data structure
accessing each method
running your tests

## Big O Notation
*binary tree*
All these methods traverse the entire tree and so are O(N)

*binary search tree*
insert method is O(log N) as you insert based on value
find method is O(log N)
isBalanced method is O(N) as you compare the entire trees
remove is O(log N)
